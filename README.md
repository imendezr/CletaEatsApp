CletaEats
A food delivery app built with Jetpack Compose, following MVVM and Clean Architecture principles.
Architecture

MVVM: Separates UI (composables), presentation (ViewModels), and data (Repository).
Layers:
UI: Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3, modular composables in ui/screens and ui/components.
Presentation: ViewModels in viewmodel using mutableStateOf and coroutines.
Data: CletaEatsRepository handles local file storage (JSON) with Gson, using mock data initialization.
Domain: Business logic in repository methods.


Dependency Injection: Hilt for injecting dependencies (@HiltViewModel, @Inject).
Navigation: Jetpack Navigation with NavHost in NavGraph.kt, with safe argument parsing.

Features

User login/register with validation (cedula, phone, email, address).
Restaurant browsing with responsive design (WindowSizeClass, ListDetailPaneScaffold for large screens).
Order creation with combo validation and closest delivery person assignment.
Order status updates with progress indicators ("en preparaci√≥n", "entregado").
Reporting for restaurant revenue and popularity.
Local data persistence (clientes.txt, pedidos.txt, etc.) with mock initialization.
Safe navigation with try-catch for JSON parsing.
Animations for UI state changes (AnimatedVisibility, fadeIn/fadeOut).
Retry logic for file I/O operations.

Dependencies

Jetpack Compose: UI framework.
Material Design 3: Theming and components.
Hilt: Dependency injection for navigation.
Coil: Image loading (AsyncImage).
Gson: JSON serialization.
